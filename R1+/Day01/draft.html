        <article id="who-i-am">
            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm 2qb. I'm currently a <b>Computer Science student</b> at <b>VNU-HCM High School for the Gifted.</b></p>
            <p>I am currently taking the <i>100 Days of Code</i> challenge to improve my coding skills and get ready for my future jobs and volunteer work.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="targets">
            <h2>My targets for this challenge</h2>
            <p>As I take part in this challenge, I am looking forward to these things in each phase:</p>
            <h3>Phase 1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Better understanding of Computer Science</li>
                <li>Intermediate knowledge of object-oriented C++</li>
                <li>Intermediate knowledge of front-end web development</li>
                <li>Intermediate knowledge of Spigot plugin development</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Phase 2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Good foundation of Computer Science, specifically on data structures and algorithms</li>
                <li>Intermediate knowledge of full-stack web development</li>
                <li>Mastery in Spigot plugin development</li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <article id="why-the-heck-does-it-have-phases">
            <h2>Why "phases"?</h2>
            <p>As a high school student, I have to prepare for exams and other stuff, and the main reason this challenge had to be split into 2 phases is because I have a huge chunk of final exams in the middle.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="future">
            <h2>My plans after this challenge</h2>
            <p>Surprisingly enough, this is just Round 1 of <i>possibly</i> many, many rounds of the challenge. Here are my priorities in Round 2:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Focus on C# (as that's what we're studying at school next year)</li>
                <li>Continuation on web development (as part of my school's "Entropy Challenge" game show)</li>
                <li>Start working on more projects (both open-source ones and personal ones)</li>
            </ol>

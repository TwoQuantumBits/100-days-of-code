# 100 Days Of Code.
My take on a coding challenge devised by [@kallaway](https://github.com/kallaway).

## Rules
### Main Commitment
**I will code for at least an hour every day for the next one hundred (100) days,** starting on **February 20, 2021**.


### Additional Rules

1.  I will post about my progress every day [on my Twitter account](twitter.com/TwoQuantumBits) and on my [Hashnode blog](https://2qb.hashnode.dev/) using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
2.  If I spend time doing classwork, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3.  I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4.  I will update this repo with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I am not allowed to skip a day, unless there is an emergency (e.g. medical emergency), in which I can pause my progress until I am ready to continue. *Preparing for school exam counts as an emergency, however, I must continue the first day after all the exams are over.*

## The whole point of doing this
I've never thought I would ever pick up such a challenge as a high school student, but since I dream big and want to change things, something needs to be done to push myself forward.

## Goals
In this challenge, I will try my best to:

 - [ ] Write a basic AI for StarCraft using C++
 - [ ] Finish CS50 by **day 50**
	 - [ ] Week 0 - 5 by the end of **day 9** (Feb 28)

	 - [ ] Final Project by the end of **day 50** (Apr 10) (*)
